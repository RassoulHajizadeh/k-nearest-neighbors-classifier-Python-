# k-nearest-neighbors-classifier-Python-
Python implementation of K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier on Persian handwritten digits recognition:

In this repository, a k-nearest neighbors classifier has been implemented using Python. Also, the k-NN classifier has been applied
on Persian handwritten digits recognition. The train and test data are loaded by importing mat file. The train and test
data matrixes consist random selection of the Persian handwritten digit images from FHT database (140 images of each 
class for train and 140 images for test). The database consists 280 Persian handwritten digit images from 1-9 (except 2).
Each image has been vectorized. Therefore, we have a train and test data matrixes as 4096x1120 (DxN).
By changing the k value, the efect of k value can be investigated.

The defined k-NN classifier class can be used in any other code.
